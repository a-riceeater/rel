# Contributing to rel

Hey there! If you would like to help contribute to rel, please read this guide.
*Be aware, rel does not use a tokenizer, parser, lexer, or other types of functions. Instead, rel parses the string instead which can be very confusing to understand at first look!*

## Cloning the source code

To begin contributing to rel, clone the github repository onto your personal device. Whilst installing rel via [releases](https://github.com/a-riceeater/rel/releases) will install some source code (as modules may require some code), it does not include the interpreter file, which is essential to adding new features.
